# Multiple rendering implementations

If you want to use Selfie in your own web application to take screenshots of it
or a portion of it, one recommendation which applies in some (but not all) cases
is to instead consider introducing two rendering methods for the part of your
application you are interested in capturing.

Most likely you are going to want to make those a DOM renderer (for your normal
uses) and a `canvas`-based renderer for the purposes of calling `toDataURL` on
the `canvas` and obtaining the screenshot of the area of interest.

There is a risk of the two implementations going out of sync, making the capture
untrue to original, and the complexity of this isn't insignificant, but it may
be worth it for the hands-off-ness of the solution.
